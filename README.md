A reprodution of the University in 3D, made in Unity. The founders of this project is Eduardo Rodrigues, Robson Morais, Scheila Gonzalez, from the Systems of Telecomunications, Class 2023. This project was created thinking about bringing an exact replica of the University in 3D, a scenario that had the unitization of "Blende", a tool that proved to be very useful for creating the architecture, and then exported into "Unity" to facilitate access to a vast library of tools that contributed to fundamentalizing 3D modeling, a project designed to welcome all curious eyes that do not know the university to be able to visit it in a 3D scenario, and at its end leaving the paving for future expansion to virtual reality.
